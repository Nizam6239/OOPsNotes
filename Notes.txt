2. Class: Class is like a blueprint of these entities.

3. ACCESS MODIFIER:
  i. Public : Data and methods accessible to everyone.
  ii. Private : Data and methods accessible inside class.
  iii. Protected : Data and methods accessible inside class and to its access derive class.

4. ENCAPSULATION : Encapsulation is wrapping up of data & member functions in a single unit called class.

5. Constructor : Special methods invoked automatically at the time of object creation. Used for Initialisation.
  i. Same name as class
  ii. Constructor does not have a return type.
  iii. Only called once (automatically), at object creation.
  iv. Memory allocation happens when constructor is called.

6. this : this is a special pointer in C++ that points to the current object.
    i. this->prop is same as *(this).prop

7. Copy Constructor : Special Constructor (default) used to copy properties of one object into another.
